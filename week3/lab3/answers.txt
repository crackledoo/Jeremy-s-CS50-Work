sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: sort1 is Bubble because it is not Merge (because it does not display the fastest sorting time), and it displays a faster sorting time for a pre-sorted list than sort3. Bubble will always display a faster sorting time than Selection on pre-sorted lists because Bubble can (presumably!) finish sorting a finished list without redundant parsing

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: sort2 is Merge because it displays the fastest sorting time among the three programs

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: sort3 is Selection because it is not Merge and it displays a slower sorting time for a pre-sorted list than sort1. Selection will always display a slower sorting time than Bubble on pre-sorted lists because Bubble can (presumably!) finish sorting a finished list without redundant parsing
